### Hi my name is Clark James Evangelista ðŸ‘‹
  I am a full-stack developer, currently living in Ibaraki, Japan. I love solving complex algorithms and converting them into simple programs. One of my hobbies is learning anything & everything about crypto-technologies



### Fullstack web app
### Crypt Tweet  Social Media Website 

**Tech stacks: ReactJS, Redux (Context API), ExpressJS, MongoDB, REST API** 

- Website for Crypto Technology Lovers to share their thoughts and follow other people.
- I built it from scratch including authentication and used JWT for authorization 
- You can follow other users and it generates a Feed that contains posts of all the users you are following
- You can like a post, view other usersâ€™ profiles and unfollow them if you want
- Here is the website link, https://crypt-tweet.netlify.app  you can log in with username cjames123  and password qwerty and have a look

### Web Apps
### Answer Port(Firebase)

**Tech stacks: ReactJS, Firebase Authentication, FireStore Database , Redux**

- App created to help teachers get instant responses from students in a live online class
- Teachers can create a session, add students, and can share a unique link with students
- When a student opens the portal and answers something, it appears on the teacher's dashboard.
- Here is a link to the teacher's dashboard for you to try it. https://answer-port.netlify.app/

### Movie Website

**Tech stacks: ReactJS, HTML and CSS Flexbox**

- This is a website to browse and search popular movies and view posters and trailer videos
- Implemented search using a 3rd Party REST API and used routing and pagination to load 10 movies at a time.
